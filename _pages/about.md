My name is Bao-Khanh Nguyen. I am a PhD student in Applied Mathematics and Statistics supervised by Dr. Torben Sell at the University of Edinburgh (U.K.), funded by the School of Mathematics. My research focuses on Bayesian Machine Learning techniques and statistical algorithms for analysing high-dimensional data. 

I also work as an editor/ journal reviewer at the Edinburgh Student Journal of Science (U.K.).  I am a member of the Royal Statistics Society (U.K.) and the Edinburgh Mathematics Society (U.K.). I am holding a position as a Statistics and Data Science Lecturer at National Economics University (Vietnam).  

My (small) Blog Page
